;As long as supported by this library, JRI basically returns a vector so that you need to specify {:conversion :single} as the second argment to get a single number from the return value from R.

;When giving {:conversion false}, then R/eval returns the REXP object without any conversion. {:conversion :vec} and {:conversion raw} gives a Clojure vector of Double values and a Java Double array respectively.
